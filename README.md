# Single-Cycle-Mips-32-Processor
A Single Cycle MIPS 32 Processor executes one instruction per clock cycle, combining instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back in a single cycle. It includes an ALU, registers, and memory units. While straightforward, it limits clock speed since all operations must complete within one cycle.
